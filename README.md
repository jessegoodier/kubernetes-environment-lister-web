# kubernetes-web-environment-lister

Simple tool to find all the namespaces with ingresses and list the pods/containers/images.

Why was this made?
1. Easy method for the less cli-oriented folks to find environments to test against.
2. Read-only cluster-wide visibility.
3. No need for cluster-auth.
4. Easy method for auth, for secure environments.

At Kubecost, we maintain many different configs for QA and this utility was created to help our engineers find specific releases for testing.

Shout out to all the AI tools for writing a majority of this.

The CSS was generated by copilot with the request for dark mode in the style of Kubecost.

## Security Considerations

This will expose every ingress in your cluster.  Please consider the security implications of this.

See the [oauth2 readme](auth/oauth2-proxy/README.md) as an example of how to secure this.

The service is exposed by an unprivileged (no service account and non-root) nginx web server.
The cronJob that creates the html configMap has a serviceAccount with cluster-wide privileges to read the required resources and `reload restart` the nginx deployment.

## Usage

Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jessegoodier/kubernetes-environment-lister-web.git
```

Edit the manifests to fit your needs.
Then:

```sh
kubectl create ns environment-lister
kubectl create cm get-environments-script -n environment-lister --from-file get_environments.py
kubectl apply -f ./manifests -n environment-lister
```

Note that the nginx-web will have a status of `ContainerCreating` until the cronjob runs and creates the html configMap. This job runs every 13 minutes and can be configured in the [cronjob manifest](manifests/kubernetes-cronjob.yaml).

### One-off run/testing

A pod manifest is included for one-off runs of the python script. This is useful for debugging or if you don't want to wait for the cronjob to run.

```sh
kubectl create cm get_environments -n environment-lister --from-file get_environments.py
kubectl apply -f ./manifests/rbac.yaml -n environment-lister
kubectl apply -f ./testing-pod.yaml -n environment-lister
```
